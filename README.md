a guideline for the Egyptian Franco writing system. there is an
associated article [here](./embrace-franco.md) ([pdf
version](./embrace-franco.pdf)) that describes the rationale behind this
project.

state of the project
--------------------

archived

where i can find the specification itself?
------------------------------------------

[here](./compliant-franco.md).

a fork for every dialect
------------------------

this guideline is supposed to be general enough to fit all Arabic
dialects, but it\'s written with Egyptian Arabic in mind and using
Egyptian examples. cases that rarely appear in Egyptian Arabic may not
be worked on, but i can imagine other dialects speakers forking this
project to fit theirs.

how to contribute
-----------------

help is very much appreciated and needed. the only requirement is to be
an Arabic speaker, even if you don\'t use Franco we need to know what
issues in the system holding you from adopting it. you can send me an
email with your thoughts at <saad@saadnpq.com> - or contact me by any
way mentioned [here](https://saadnpq.com/pages/reachme/). if you are
familiar with git it\'s, of course, better to open an issue or a pull
request in this repository.
